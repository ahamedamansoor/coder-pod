        explanation:
          'In Java, variables are containers for storing data values. To use a variable, you must declare it by specifying its type and name. You can also initialize it by assigning an initial value. Understanding how to declare and initialize variables is a fundamental concept in Java programming.',

        title: 'Data Types',
        explanation:
          'In Java, every variable has a data type. Data types specify the size and type of values that can be stored in a variable. There are two main categories of data types: Primitive and Non-Primitive. Primitive types include `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `boolean`, and `char`. Non-primitive types (or reference types) include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays, like `String`.',

        title: 'Type Casting and Conversion',
        explanation:
          'Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type. In Java, there are two types of casting: widening casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size, and narrowing casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type.',

        slug: 'print-formats',
        title: 'Print Formats',
        explanation:
          'Java provides several ways to display output, each with its specific use case. The most common methods are part of the `System.out` object. `System.out.print()` prints text without a new line. `System.out.println()` prints text and adds a new line. For formatted output, `System.out.printf()` uses format specifiers like `%s` for strings and `%d` for integers. `String.format()` works similarly but returns a formatted string. For errors, `System.err.println()` prints to the standard error stream.',
